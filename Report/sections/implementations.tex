\section{Implementations}

In this section, we describe our implementations of multiple heuristics, which can be found \href{https://github.com/phcentenaro7/IC-CLP/tree/main/Code/Authoral/Hummingbird}{here}.

\subsection{Wall-building}
\label{sec:wb implementation}

The wall-building (WB) heuristic attempts to load a single container by stacking cuboids within layers. A layer is a space with the same width and height as the container, but a lesser depth. To determine the depth of a layer, a box type is selected according to \cref{flow:primary box selection WBH}, where, for simplicity, \emph{box} is synonymous with \emph{box type}.

\input{tikz/wb_primary_box_selection.tex}

Once a box type is filtered, the feasible rotation with the greatest depth is selected, and the same depth is applied to the layer, as \cref{fig:WB layer example} shows. For unconstrained boxes, any of the six cuboid rotations is feasible. However, for boxes with a fixed height, only two rotations are feasible. \cref{fig:cuboid rotations} illustrates this.

\input{tikz/cuboid_rotations.tex}

From this point on, we refer to the box type that defines a layer's depth as its \emph{primary box type}. In its initial state, a layer contains a single empty cuboid space, which we call \emph{primary space}. Because they have the same depth, primary boxes are always loaded into primary spaces.

\input{tikz/wb_layer_depth_example.tex}

After the initial loading process, the primary space is divided into smaller cuboid spaces, which we call \emph{secondary spaces}. \cref{fig:remaining spaces first filling WBH A} illustrates this situation. In this example, two \emph{heightwise} spaces are created above the primary boxes, and one \emph{widthwise} space is created to their right. \cref{fig:remaining spaces first filling WBH B} shows the state of the layer after loading boxes into the widthwise space. In this case, one heightwise space is created on top of the secondary boxes, and one \emph{depthwise} space is created in front of them. The loading process is complete when none of the remaining spaces can be filled with the available box types. \cref{flow:secondary box selection WBH} is used to determine the box type for filling secondary spaces.

\input{tikz/wb_box_placements.tex}

\input{tikz/wb_secondary_box_selection.tex}

Before we discuss the loading procedure, we must introduce the concept of amalgamation. Suppose that after the layer in \cref{fig:remaining spaces first filling WBH} is fully loaded, the depthwise space created in \cref{fig:remaining spaces first filling WBH B} remains empty because no box type could fit in it. This depthwise space will be adjacent to the next layer in the container, which means it can be amalgamated with the next layer in an attempt to reduce wasted space. For instance, consider \cref{fig:amalgamation example}, which consists of the top view of two layers. The previous layer contains two empty depthwise spaces, which we assume to be at the same height or below the current layer (otherwise, no amalgamation is possible). Since space $\Omega$ has the least depth, any box we place within it is guaranteed not to overlap with other boxes from the previous layer, and thus we choose $\Omega$ to amalgamate with. After the amalgamation, the original space is split into two, $S_{L} = L$ and $S_{R} = R \cup \Omega$, with widths $w_L$ and $w_R$, respectively. However, changing these widths during loading might lead to better space utilization, which is why we introduce a \emph{flexible width} parameter, $\hat{w} = \phi w_{R}$, with $\phi \in [0,1]$. As we clarify further ahead (\cref{flow:box loading procedure WBH}), this parameter allows for the width of $S_L$ to grow to at most $w_L + \hat{w}$, with the width of $S_R$ decreasing accordingly.

\input{tikz/wb_amalgamation.tex}

We now describe the loading procedure. Let $B_{wh}$ be the box selected through \cref{flow:primary box selection WBH} or \cref{flow:secondary box selection WBH}, and $B_{hw}$ a rotation that swaps its width and height. If $B_{wh}$ has a fixed height, or if $B_{hw}$ does not fit in the space, then we keep $B_{wh}$. Otherwise, if enough stock exists to complete a column with either rotation, we select the rotation that results in the highest column. If neither rotation completes a column, we choose the rotation with the greatest height. This leads us to \cref{flow:box loading procedure WBH}, which describes how spaces are filled using the selected box type. Since spaces are filled by side-by-side columns of a single box rotation, determining the cuboid spaces that remain after loading is trivial.

\input{tikz/wb_loading_procedure.tex}

With this procedure, a single container can be loaded with items. To generalize the loading process to multiple containers, \cref{alg:wb mclp} is used.

\subsection{Genetic algorithm}

The GA developed is a simplified version of the one presented by \textcite{GONÃ‡ALVES2011}. Let $N$ be the number of items in stock. In this case, each chromosome is composed of $2N$ alleles, with genes in the interval $[0, 1]$. Let $L$ be a list of all the items in stock. The first $N$ genes of a chromosome rearrange the items in $L$ in ascending order. Subsequently, the algorithm places the items in the order specified by the rearranged version of $L$.

As an example, suppose $L = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3)$, where each number corresponds to the type of a certain item in stock. Now suppose a chromosome whose first five genes are $(0.93, 0.42, 0.17, 0.48, 0.80)$. If we rearrange these numbers in ascending order, we obtain $(0.17, 0.42, 0.48, 0.80, 0.93)$. By equivalently swapping the items in $L$, we get its rearrangement $L_r = (2, 1, 2, 3, 1)$.
