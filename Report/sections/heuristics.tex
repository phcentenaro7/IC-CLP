\section{Heuristics for packing problems}

We now look at heuristics for the CLP.

\subsection{Wall-building}

This constructive heuristic was proposed by \textcite{GEORGE1980}, aiming to solve the CLP for a single container. In each iteration of the wall-building heuristic (WBH), what remains of the container is sliced by a plane parallel to its width and height, up to a certain depth. The resulting space is called a layer of the container.

\end{figure}

To choose the depth of a new layer, we must first select a box, which we will call the layer's primary box. The primary box is selected as detailed in \cref{flow:primary box selection WBH}. Notice that we use the term ``box'' to refer to box types -- that is, the set of dimensions that define a box's volume. Hence, a box's ``quantity'' is the amount of boxes of said type that has yet to be packed.

        \node (start) [startstop] {Start};
        %\node (proc1) [process, below of=start] {Filter remaining boxes};
        \node (dec1) [decision, below of=start, align=center, yshift=-1cm] {Has any remaining\\ box already\\been placed?};
        \node (proc2) [process, left of=dec1, align=center, xshift=-4cm] {Select box according\\to ranking criteria};
        \node (proc3) [process, right of=dec1, align=center, xshift=4cm] {Select placed box\\with greatest\\quantity left};
        \node (end) [startstop, below of=dec1, yshift=-1cm] {End};

        \draw [arrow] (start) -- (dec1);
        %\draw [arrow] (proc1) -- (dec1);
        \draw [arrow] (dec1) -- node[anchor=south] {No} (proc2);
        \draw [arrow] (dec1) -- node[anchor=south] {Yes} (proc3);
        \draw [arrow,rounded corners=0.2cm] (proc2) |- (end);
        \draw [arrow,rounded corners=0.2cm] (proc3) |- (end);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \renewcommand\figurename{Flowchart}
    \caption{Primary box selection procedure}
    \label[flowchart]{flow:primary box selection WBH}
\end{figure}

The ``ranking criteria'' in \cref{flow:primary box selection WBH} are as follows: First, we filter the boxes with the greatest smallest dimension. In case of ties, we filter the selected box with the greatest remaining quantity to pack. If ties persist, we choose one of the boxes with the greatest dimension. The intuition behind these choices is that it is better to pack larger items first, to avoid complications trying to fit them with smaller items later on. It is also preferable to pack numerous boxes first, in order to reduce their numbers quickly.

Layers provide an initial space into which boxes can be placed. For this initial space, the chosen box to start the filling process is the primary box, since it can be rotated to perfectly fit the space's depth. Once this space is filled with as many primary boxes as possible, certain unfilled spaces might remain. \cref{fig:remaining spaces first filling WBH A} illustrates this situation. The two spaces on top of the boxes are called height-wise spaces, while the space to the right is called width-wise space. If, for example, we fill any of the remaining spaces, new unfilled spaces might appear. \cref{fig:remaining spaces first filling WBH B} shows this situation. Notice that an unfilled space in front of the filling appears -- this is called a depth-wise space.

To figure out whether a space should be stored in memory for filling, we only need to check if its height or its width (in the case of a height- or width-wise space, respectively) is greater than the smallest dimension of any remaining box. Depth-wise spaces are created regardless of any such check, because they may be \emph{amalgamated} later on. For example, consider the top view of two layers in \cref{fig:amalgamation example}. The previous layer was packed with two depth-wise spaces left unfilled. We select the depth-wise space with minimal depth to amalgamate with the space in the current layer.
