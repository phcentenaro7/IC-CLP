Given container dimensions and a set of furniture items, the problem is to determine a subset of items with maximal profit sum that is loadable in the container. In the studied company, the problem arises hundreds of times daily during transport planning. Instances may contain more than one hundred different items with irregular shapes. To solve this complex problem we apply a set of heuristics successively that each solve one part of the problem. Large items are combined in specific structures to ensure proper protection of the items during transportation and to simplify the problem. The solutions generated by the heuristic has an average loading utilization of 91.3\% for the most general instances with average running times around 100 seconds.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a multi-population biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) for the single container loading problem (3D-CLP) where several rectangular boxes of different sizes are loaded into a single rectangular container. The approach uses a maximal-space representation to manage the free spaces in the container. The proposed algorithm hybridizes a novel placement procedure with a multipopulation genetic algorithm based on random keys. The BRKGA is used to evolve the order in which the box types are loaded into the container and the corresponding type of layer used in the placement procedure. A heuristic is used to determine the maximal space where each box is placed. A novel procedure is developed for joining free spaces in the case where full support from below is required. The approach is extensively tested on the complete set of test problem instances of Bischoff and Ratcliff [1] and Davies and Bischoff [2] and is compared with 13 other approaches. The test set consists of 1500 instances from weakly to strongly heterogeneous cargo. The computational experiments demonstrate that not only the approach performs very well in all types of instance classes but also it obtains the best overall results when compared with other approaches published in the literature.},

The 3D-CLP is the problem of loading a subset of a given set of rectangular boxes into a rectangular container so that the packed volume is maximized. The method has two variants: the packing variant guarantees full support from below for all packed boxes, while this constraint is not taken into account by the cutting variant. The guillotine cut constraint is considered by both variants. The method is mainly based on two concepts. On the one hand the block building approach is generalized. Not only blocks of identical boxes in the same spatial orientation are applied but also blocks of different boxes with small inner gaps. On the other hand the tree search is carried out in a special fashion called a partitioncontrolled tree search (PCTRS). This makes the search both efficient and diverse, enabling a sufficient search width as well as a suitable degree of foresight. The approach achieves excellent results for the well-known 3D-CLP instances suggested by Bischoff and Ratcliff with reasonable computing time.},

In this algorithm, all the boxes are grouped into strips and layers while three constraints, i.e., full support constraint, orientation constraint and guillotine cutting constraint are satisfied. A binary tree is created where each tree node denotes a container loading plan. For a non-root each node, the layer set of its left (or right) child is obtained by inserting a directed layer into its layer set. A directed layer is parallel (or perpendicular) to the left side of the container. Each leaf node denotes a complete container loading plan. The solution is the layer set whose total volume of the boxes is the greatest among all tree nodes.

The mathematical model of an E. coli fed-batch cultivation process is studied. The three model parameters -- maximum specific growth rate ({\textmu}max), saturation constant (kS) and yield coefficient (YS/X ) are estimated using different population sizes. Population sizes between 5 and 200 chromosomes in the population are tested with constant number of generations. In order to obtain meaningful information about the influence of the population size a considerable number of independent runs of the GA are performed. The observed results show that the optimal population size is 100 chromosomes for 200 generations. In this case accurate model parameters values are obtained in reasonable computational time. Further increase of the population size, above 100 chromosomes, does not improve the solution accuracy. Moreover, the computational time is increased significantly.},

An optimized solution requires an efficient decision to carry out network packets from sender to receiver with excellent efficiency. Energy-efficient routing techniques can be developed using metaheuristics to help network packets travel from sender to receiver in less time with low power consumption. Low power consumption minimizes the node-to-node transfer of packets using a minimum of resources and enhances the life span of the network cycle. Metaheuristics provide a great optimized solution by finding an optimized path for the packet transfer and minimizing the node-to-node transfer, thus resulting in less resource consumption. The optimization technique includes various algorithms and several theoretical concepts. Various applications are present to reduce energy consumption, but the efficiency obtained from metaheuristics is more precise and efficient than existing models. In this chapter, we discuss the various methods of efficient packet transfer with low consumption. Adaptive and nonadaptive algorithms are discussed as well as various types of metaheuristics.},

We introduce a so-called centralized version of the circumcentered-reflection method (CRM). Developed with the aim of accelerating classical projection algorithms, CRM is successful for tracking a common point of a finite number of affine sets. In the case of general convex sets, CRM was shown to possibly diverge if Pierra's product space reformulation is not used. In this work, we prove that there exists an easily reachable region consisting of what we refer to as centralized points, where pure circumcenter steps possess properties yielding convergence. The resulting algorithm is called centralized CRM (cCRM). In addition to having global convergence, cCRM converges linearly under an error bound condition, and superlinearly if the two target sets are so that their intersection have nonempty interior and their boundaries are locally differentiable manifolds. We also run numerical experiments with successful results.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new and practical method for a control design of a robotic system. In general, actuators in robotic systems are set with gears whose characteristics are elastic. Since a state feedback-type digital controller is usually used for such a robotic system, the design of the feedback gain of the controller is important, because undesirable vibrations or an overshoot in responses occur for high gains. Therefore the desired response, the output of a reference model, is designed first, and the feedback gains are determined so that the response will coincide with the desired response, which is an optimization problem. The gradient method works to some extent, but it takes a long time to get a satisfactory result. Thus we applied the genetic algorithm (GA) to this nonlinear optimization problem, which gave the very first convergence. The gains obtained have many useful applications. The results of a simulation are also given.},

  abstract = {Life presents us with problems of varying complexity. Yet, complexity is not accounted for in theories of human decision-making. Here we study instances of the knapsack problem, a discrete optimisation problem commonly encountered at all levels of cognition, from attention gating to intellectual discovery. Complexity of this problem is well understood from the perspective of a mechanical device like a computer. We show experimentally that human performance too decreased with complexity as defined in computer science. Defying traditional economic principles, participants spent effort way beyond the point where marginal gain was positive, and economic performance increased with instance difficulty. Human attempts at solving the instances exhibited commonalities with algorithms developed for computers, although biological resource constraints--limited working and episodic memories--had noticeable impact. Consistent with the very nature of the knapsack problem, only a minority of participants found the solution--often quickly--but the ones who did appeared not to realise. Substantial heterogeneity emerged, suggesting why prizes and patents, schemes that incentivise intellectual discovery but discourage information sharing, have been found to be less effective than mechanisms that reveal private information, such as markets.},

  abstract = {Os problemas de roteamento de ve{\'i}culos (PRVs) dizem respeito {\`a} escolha da melhor rota que cada ve{\'i}culo de uma ou mais frotas pode realizar, dado um conjunto de pontos de atendimento. Entre os problemas desta categoria, podemos citar a entrega de encomendas, a defini{\c c}{\~a}o de linhas de {\^o}nibus, o posicionamento de ambul{\^a}ncias, a coleta de lixo e muitos outros. Dependendo da natureza do problema, {\'e} poss{\'i}vel encontrar restri{\c c}{\~o}es quanto {\`a}s capacidades de carga dos ve{\'i}culos, {\`a}s janelas de tempo dispon{\'i}veis para servir cada ponto, ao consumo de energia dos ve{\'i}culos el{\'e}tricos e v{\'a}rios outros fatores. O objetivo deste trabalho de inicia{\c c}{\~a}o cient{\'i}fica {\'e} estudar os aspectos matem{\'a}ticos da modelagem e resolu{\c c}{\~a}o computacional dos PRVs. Para tal, v{\'a}rias abordagens foram utilizadas. Para contextualizar e motivar o estudo da roteiriza{\c c}{\~a}o de ve{\'i}culos, estudaram-se tend{\^e}ncias de urbaniza{\c c}{\~a}o, entre as quais pode-se citar a substitui{\c c}{\~a}o gradual de {\^o}nibus a combust{\~a}o por ve{\'i}culos el{\'e}tricos ou h{\'i}bridos. Entre as muitas barreiras {\`a} introdu{\c c}{\~a}o destes ve{\'i}culos nas frotas, uma not{\'a}vel {\'e} a necessidade de garantir que as linhas dos {\^o}nibus el{\'e}tricos e h{\'i}bridos sejam otimizadas, de modo que os gastos com esta{\c c}{\~o}es de recarga sejam compensados o mais r{\'a}pido poss{\'i}vel, sem prejudicar a popula{\c c}{\~a}o. Estudou-se tamb{\'e}m o espraiamento urbano, condi{\c c}{\~a}o na qual a popula{\c c}{\~a}o mais pobre de uma cidade {\'e} for{\c c}ada a estabelecer moradia em regi{\~o}es marginais. Como resultado, definir rotas de {\^o}nibus que melhor atendam todos os cidad{\~a}os se torna um processo mais complicado. Para compreender a matem{\'a}tica por tr{\'a}s dos PRVs, estudaram-se teoria de grafos e otimiza{\c c}{\~a}o linear. A terminologia dos grafos {\'e} muito difundida entre pesquisadores de roteiriza{\c c}{\~a}o e, portanto, sua investiga{\c c}{\~a}o {\'e} necess{\'a}ria para o processo de modelagem dos problemas. J{\'a} a otimiza{\c c}{\~a}o linear {\'e} usada em conjunto com outras t{\'e}cnicas para resolver os modelos gerados. O estudo de otimiza{\c c}{\~a}o linear deste trabalho resultou na implementa{\c c}{\~a}o de um pacote em linguagem Julia, o Caique.jl, que resolve problemas utilizando o m{\'e}todo simplex. Este pacote pode ser acessado em https://github.com/phcentenaro7/Caique.jl. Para realizar testes computacionais de roteiriza{\c c}{\~a}o, optou-se por modelar tr{\^e}s formula{\c c}{\~o}es do problema do caixeiro viajante (PCV, o PRV mais simples que existe), implementando-as no pacote JuMP, do Julia, que faz a tradu{\c c}{\~a}o dos modelos para cada uma das tr{\^e}s ferramentas de resolu{\c c}{\~a}o (solvers) testadas. Foi poss{\'i}vel constatar diferen{\c c}as nos desempenhos das formula{\c c}{\~o}es e dos solvers e relacion{\'a}-las a quest{\~o}es matem{\'a}ticas relatadas na literatura. Por fim, constatou-se a possibilidade de interpretar e comparar modelos mais complexos de PRVs com base no que foi aprendido com os PCVs. Concluiu-se que este trabalho abre espa{\c c}o a investiga{\c c}{\~o}es mais aprofundadas sobre PRVs no futuro.},

  abstract = {Vehicle routing is a well-known optimization research topic with significant practical importance. Among different approaches to solving vehicle routing, heuristics can produce a satisfactory solution at a reasonable computational cost. Consequently, much effort has been made in the past decades to develop vehicle routing heuristics. In this article, we systematically survey the existing vehicle routing heuristics, particularly on works carried out in recent years. A classification of vehicle routing heuristics is presented, followed by a review of their methodologies, recent developments, and applications. Moreover, we present a general framework of state-of-the-art methods and provide insights into their success. Finally, three emerging research topics with notable works and future directions are discussed.},

Such problem spaces are characterized by a low degree of epistasis. A host of classical search problems, however, are epistatic in nature. The present paper describes some new techniques for applying adaptive algorithms to epistatic domains, while retaining some of the strength of Holland's convergence proof. These techniques are described for two-dimensional bin-packing problems, and summarized for graph coloring problems. What makes these problems amenable to an adaptive approach is a two-stage evaluation procedure. Encodings of solutions are mutated and reproduced as they are in non-epistatic domains, but their evaluation is carried out after a decoding process. Using the techniques described, convergence is promoted in two ways: one of the natural mutation operators is a weaker version of Holland's crossover, and domain knowledge may be built into decoding processes so that the size of the search space is radically cut down.},

Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

To answer such challenges a new communication paradigm, data-centric communication, is emerging. One form of data-centric communication is the publish/subscribe messaging system. Compared with other data-centric variants, publish/subscribe systems are common and wide-spread in distributed computing. Thus, extending publish/subscribe systems into WSNs will simplify the integration of sensor applications with other distributed applications. This paper describes MQTT-S [1], an extension of the open publish/subscribe protocol Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [2] to WSNs. MQTT-S is designed in such a way that it can be run on low-end and battery-operated sensor/actuator devices and operate over bandwidth-constraint WSNs such as ZigBee-based networks. Various protocol design points are discussed and compared. MQTT-S has been implemented and is currently being tested on the IBM wireless sensor networking testbed [3].

  abstract = {The goal for real-time mobile robots is to travel the shortest path in minimal time while avoiding obstacles in a navigation environment. Autonomous navigation allows robots to plan this path without the need for human intervention. The path-planning problem has been shown to be NP-hard, thus this problem is often solved using heuristic optimization methods such as genetic algorithms. An important part of the genetic algorithm solution is the structure of the genotype that represents paths in the navigation environment. The genotype must represent a valid path, but still be simple to process by the genetic algorithm in order to reduce computational requirements. Unfortunately, many contemporary genetic path-planning algorithms use complex structures that require a significant amount of processing, which can affect the real-time response of the robot. This paper describes the development of a genotype structure that contains only the essential information for path planning, which allows for more efficient processing. A genetic algorithm using this structure was tested on a variety of simulated navigation spaces and was found to produce valid, obstacle-free paths for most cases.},

  abstract = {Nowadays billions of smart devices or things are present in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, such as homes, hospitals, factories, and vehicles, all around the world. As a result, the number of interconnected devices is continuously and rapidly growing. These devices communicate with each other and with other services using various communication protocols for the transportation of sensor or event data. These protocols enable applications to collect, store, process, describe, and analyze data to solve a variety of problems. IoT also aims to provide secure, bi-directional communication between interconnected devices, such as sensors, actuators, microcontrollers or smart appliances, and corresponding cloud services. In this paper we analyze the growth of M2M protocol research (MQTT, AMQP, and CoAP) over the past 20 years, and show how the growth in MQTT research stands out from the rest. We also gather relevant application areas of MQTT, as the most widespread M2M/IoT protocol, by performing a detailed literature search in major digital research archives. Our quantitative evaluation presents some of the important MQTT-related studies published in the past five years, which we compare to discuss the main features, advantages, and limitations of the MQTT protocol. We also propose a taxonomy to compare the properties and features of various MQTT implementations, i.e. brokers and libraries currently available in the public domain to help researchers and end-users to efficiently choose a broker or client library based on their requirements. Finally, we discuss the relevant findings of our comparison and highlight open issues that need further research and attention.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, genetic algorithms have relied upon 1 and 2-point crossover operators. Many recent empirical studies, however, have shown the benefits of higher numbers of crossover points. Some of the most intriguing recent work has focused on uniform crossover, which involves on the average L/2 crossover points for strings of length L. Theoretical results suggest that, from the view of hyperplane sampling disruption, uniform crossover has few redeeming features. However, a growing body of experimental evidence suggests otherwise. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these opposing views of uniform crossover and present a framework for understanding its virtues. 1 Introduction One of the unique aspects of the work involving genetic algorithms (GAs) is the important role that recombination plays. In most GAs, recombination is implemented by means of a crossover operator which operates on pairs of individuals (parents) to produce new offspring by exchanging segments from the parents' ...}

  abstract = {Modern robotic systems are tied to operate autonomously in real-world environments performing a variety of complex tasks. Autonomous robots must rely on fundamental capabilities such as locomotion, trajectory tracking control, multi-sensor fusion, task/path planning, navigation, and real-time perception. Combining this knowledge is essential to design rolling, walking, aquatic, and hovering robots that sense and self-control.   This book contains a mathematical modelling framework to support the learning of modern robotics and mechatronics, aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. The volume exposes a solid understanding of mathematical methods as a common modelling framework to properly interpret advanced robotic systems. Including numerical approximations, solution of linear and non-linear systems of equations, curves fitting, differentiation and integration of functions.   The book is suitable for courses on robotics, mechatronics, sensing models, vehicles design and control, modelling, simulation, and mechanisms analysis. It is organised with 17 chapters divided in five parts that conceptualise classical mechanics to model a wide variety of applied robotics. It comprehends a hover-craft, an amphibious hexapod, self-reconfiguration and under-actuation of rolling and passive walking robots with Hoekens, Klann, and Jansen limbs for bipedal, quadruped, and octapod robots.},

  abstract = {Background: This review addresses the emerging field of automated packing cells, which lies at the intersection of robotics and packing problems. Integrating these two fields is critical for optimizing logistics and e-commerce operations. The current literature focuses on packing problems or specific robotic applications without addressing their integration. Methods: To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive review of 46 relevant studies, analyzing various dimensions, including the components of robotic packing cells, the types of packing problems, the solution approaches, and performance comparisons. Results: Our review reveals a significant trend towards addressing online packing problems, which reflects the dynamic nature of logistics operations where item information is often incomplete. We also identify several research gaps, such as the need for standardized terminologies, comprehensive methodologies, and the consideration of real-world constraints in robotic algorithms. Conclusions: This review uniquely integrates insights from robotics and packing problems, providing a structured framework for future research. It highlights the importance of considering practical robotic constraints. It proposes a research structure that enhances the reproducibility and comparability of results in real-world scenarios. By doing so, we aim to guide future research efforts and facilitate the development of more robust and practical automated packing systems.},

In this study, assuming multiple grippers, we propose a method for automatically planning the motion of a robot that packs objects into a box , considering whether the grippers can grasp the objects and pack them in a box. The proposed method first determines the appropriate gripper candidates for grasping each object. The initial solution is then generated by arranging the objects in random order and placing them in the available space in order, considering the gripper for each object. To increase the filling rate of each container and reduce the final number of required containers, the system repeatedly exchanges and replaces the objects in each container. Finally, the grasping and placement postures using the appropriate gripper are obtained for each object position, based on which the packing motion is planned. Through simulation and experiments, we determine the container and the position where the object is to be inserted, and confirm that the object can be placed in a suboptimal position by planning the grasping motion of the robot without collision using a gripper that can grasp the object.},

  title = {An Overview on Container Loading Problems.},
  author = {Centenaro, Pedro Henrique},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {The logistic process of loading cargo into containers encompasses all industries, being a crucial step to improve the delivery of goods. In order to obtain competitive advantages, companies seek to maximize the total volume or profit of the loaded items, while also minimizing the number of containers needed to deliver products. Moreover, the loading process may be complicated by constraints such as weight limits and box orientations. Though it is mathematically possible to model container loading problems (CLPs), solving them to optimality is practically impossible, due to their combinatorial nature. Thus, most of the research on this topic has focused on heuristics that produce good solutions in an acceptable amount of time. In light of these facts, this overview investigates the types of CLPs that have been proposed and considered by researchers, and the constraints that have been tackled the most. We also investigate a few heuristics in greater detail, based on their importance and ability to illustrate the different techniques that can be used to solve CLPs. We observe that most researchers have focused on solving CLPs with a wide variety of boxes and few container types. Furthermore, the average number of constraints considered in papers has changed little in three decades. This indicates the existence of many gaps in the literature. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the almost stagnant exploration of CLPs may be explained by the authors' focus on improving the efficiency of container loading based on previous works that are already biased towards certain problem configurations. We conclude that society will benefit from efforts to close research gaps and make CLP software more accessible to laypersons.},

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications.In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.},
