In the studied company, the problem arises hundreds of times daily during transport planning. Instances may contain more than one hundred different items with irregular shapes. To solve this complex problem we apply a set of heuristics successively that each solve one part of the problem. Large items are combined in speciﬁc structures to ensure proper protection of the items during transportation and to simplify the problem. The solutions generated by the heuristic has an average loading utilization of 91.3\% for the most general instances with average running times around 100 seconds.},

The approach uses a maximal-space representation to manage the free spaces in the container. The proposed algorithm hybridizes a novel placement procedure with a multipopulation genetic algorithm based on random keys. The BRKGA is used to evolve the order in which the box types are loaded into the container and the corresponding type of layer used in the placement procedure. A heuristic is used to determine the maximal space where each box is placed. A novel procedure is developed for joining free spaces in the case where full support from below is required. The approach is extensively tested on the complete set of test problem instances of Bischoff and Ratcliff [1] and Davies and Bischoff [2] and is compared with 13 other approaches. The test set consists of 1500 instances from weakly to strongly heterogeneous cargo. The computational experiments demonstrate that not only the approach performs very well in all types of instance classes but also it obtains the best overall results when compared with other approaches published in the literature.},

The 3D-CLP is the problem of loading a subset of a given set of rectangular boxes into a rectangular container so that the packed volume is maximized. The method has two variants: the packing variant guarantees full support from below for all packed boxes, while this constraint is not taken into account by the cutting variant. The guillotine cut constraint is considered by both variants. The method is mainly based on two concepts. On the one hand the block building approach is generalized. Not only blocks of identical boxes in the same spatial orientation are applied but also blocks of different boxes with small inner gaps. On the other hand the tree search is carried out in a special fashion called a partitioncontrolled tree search (PCTRS). This makes the search both efficient and diverse, enabling a sufficient search width as well as a suitable degree of foresight. The approach achieves excellent results for the well-known 3D-CLP instances suggested by Bischoff and Ratcliff with reasonable computing time.},

The 3D-CLP is about how to load a subset of a given set of rectangular boxes into a rectangular container, such that the packing volume is maximized. In this algorithm, all the boxes are grouped into strips and layers while three constraints, i.e., full support constraint, orientation constraint and guillotine cutting constraint are satisﬁed. A binary tree is created where each tree node denotes a container loading plan. For a non-root each node, the layer set of its left (or right) child is obtained by inserting a directed layer into its layer set. A directed layer is parallel (or perpendicular) to the left side of the container. Each leaf node denotes a complete container loading plan. The solution is the layer set whose total volume of the boxes is the greatest among all tree nodes.

	abstract = {In this paper, an investigation of the inﬂuence of the population size on the genetic algorithm (GA) performance for a model parameter identiﬁcation problem, is considered. The mathematical model of an E. coli fed-batch cultivation process is studied. The three model parameters – maximum speciﬁc growth rate (µmax), saturation constant (kS) and yield coefﬁcient (YS/X ) are estimated using different population sizes. Population sizes between 5 and 200 chromosomes in the population are tested with constant number of generations. In order to obtain meaningful information about the inﬂuence of the population size a considerable number of independent runs of the GA are performed. The observed results show that the optimal population size is 100 chromosomes for 200 generations. In this case accurate model parameters values are obtained in reasonable computational time. Further increase of the population size, above 100 chromosomes, does not improve the solution accuracy. Moreover, the computational time is increased signiﬁcantly.},
